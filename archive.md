# The Archive
The Archive, a place where artifacts, knowledge, books and myths are stored. However getting there is quiet complicated. It's a place for no ordinary place for common people. Wizards, sorcerers, sorceresses, necromancers gather there to share tales about their journeys throughout the realms. Violence became forbidden after demons from Nouzur invaded The Archive. They inflitrated through possessed wizards abd other creatures. To enter the Archive he has to perform a ritual, with a skull, a sword, a gemstone, a pen and a gold coin. Each represents a characteristics of knowledge. The being, who created the library was an elder lich, born far before The Great War of the Realms. He fell in love with a common girl on one of his travels. The girl was of farmers, lived in decent conditions. When the lich got injured in a fight with Mephistom, he fell on her garden, losing consciousness. After tending his wounds and gicing him new clothes the girl noticed him being and elder lich. But she showed no signs of fear. The lich whispered one name in his long slumber:
>*Kraum'daidh...*

He woke up. The first thing he noticed was the small girl's bright red face. That is because he hadn't noticed he grabbed her hand after waking up. Liches' touch reflect the current state of their emotions and feelings. While recovering his subconsciousness became calm and relaxed in the small house. He felt safe, but couldn't put it into words why.<br>
Aren't you scared of me?<br>
I was, when I first noticed you, but you didn't show any signs of aggression and honestly, I saw some kind of brightness in your eyes. Not the kind of darkness you would expect from liches.<br>
Why did you help me? If I'm seeing it right there aren't my clothes and my staff is clean of blood...<br>
It just felt right to help someone so badly injured. I did the best I could but my medicine is limited to humans and animals.<br>
Thanks, that's very kind of you. Are you alone in this small house? Don't you feel, alone?<br>
I lost my family in a rebellion against King Volgar... they all fought on the frontline. Since then, my animals and nature became my family.<br>
My deepest condolences. If you don't mind me asking, could I stay here for a while, just to regain my strength?<br>
Stay as long as you like, I could appreciate some company.<br>
That is how a human girl and an elder lich met. From this point forward they lives and ate together. Kraum'daidh helped where he could, tending the garden, gathering herbs. One night he asked Anaul if he could join her company tonight. It was the day of Awakening and he could have appreciated some company, after all, elder liches too have a soul.<br>
Sorry for the intrusion, could I share your company this night? If you don't mind.<br>
I wanted to ask the same thing, but didn't have the courage...<br>
Do you regret welcoming me into your home 5 months ago?<br>
Not at all, only the opposite. You became the light in my darkest days. I just regret one thing.<br>
And what would that be?<br>
Slowly Anael leaned into Kraum'daidh's face with a slight smile.
Not realizing how kind of a soul you are...<br>
After hearing the kindest and most heart-warming words he ever got, he grabbed her by her bright and smooth face and kissed her.
