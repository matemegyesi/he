# The Archive
The Archive, a place where artefacts, knowledge, books and myths are stored. However getting there is quiet complicated. It's not an ordinary place for common people. Wizards, sorcerers, sorceresses, necromancers gather there to share tales about their journeys throughout the realms. To enter the Archive thou shall to perform a ritual, with a skull, a sword, a gemstone, a pen and a gold coin. Each represents a characteristics of knowledge and peace. The being, who created the library was an elder lich, born far before The Great War of the Realms. He fell in love with a common girl on one of his travels. The girl was of farmers, lived in decent conditions. When the lich got injured in a fight with Vugoron, he fell on her garden, losing consciousness. After tending his wounds and giving him new clothes the girl noticed him being and elder lich. But she showed no signs of fear. The lich whispered one name in his long slumber:
>*Kraum'daidh...*

He woke up. The first thing he noticed was the small girl's bright red face. That is because he hadn't noticed he grabbed her hand after waking up. Liches' touch reflect the current state of their emotions and feelings. While recovering, his subconsciousness became calm and relaxed in the small house. He felt safe, but couldn't put it into words why. The girl first seemed a bit nervous, not scared, afraid. She must have strengthened her will, after all, she is living in a small house, far from civilization.<br>
Aren't you scared of me?<br>
I was, when I first noticed you, but you didn't show any signs of aggression and honestly, I saw some kind of brightness in your eyes. Not the kind of darkness you would expect from liches.<br>
Why did you help me? If I'm seeing it right there aren't my clothes and my staff is clean of blood...<br>
It just felt right to help someone so badly injured. I did the best I could but my medicine is limited to humans and animals.<br>
Thanks, that's very kind of you. Are you alone in this small house? Don't you feel, alone?<br>
I lost my family in a rebellion against King Volgar... they all fought on the frontline. Since then, my animals and nature became my family.<br>
My deepest condolences. If you don't mind me asking, could I stay here for a while, just to regain my strength?<br>
Stay as long as you like, I could appreciate some company.<br>
That is how a human girl and an elder lich met. From this point forward they lives and ate together. Kraum'daidh helped where he could, tending the garden, gathering herbs. One night he asked Anaul if he could join her company tonight. It was the day of Awakening and he didn't want to be alone, after all, elder liches have a soul too.<br>
Sorry for the intrusion, could I share your company this night? If you don't mind.<br>
I wanted to ask the same thing, but didn't have the courage...<br>
Do you regret welcoming me into your home 5 months ago?<br>
Not at all, only the opposite. You became the light in my darkest days. I just regret one thing.<br>
And what would that be?<br>
Slowly Anael leaned into Kraum'daidh's face with a slight smile.<br>
Not realizing how kind of a soul you are...<br>
After hearing the kindest and most heart-warming words he ever got, he grabbed her by her bright and smooth face and kissed her.<br>
The long waited moment finally came for both of them. The girl, who isolated herself from society and the lich who wandered aimlessly finally found a purpose to keep going. A soul. Anael lost hers after having to endure such horrific things with her family. Kraum'daidh didn't think he had a soul, he was ruthless, cold-blooded and inhuman. They both found something they lost along the way.<br>
Are you sure? I mean, is this really what you want?<br>
I would make a deal with the devil, so I can watch every sunrise and sunrest, every star fall, every solar eclipse, every star, with *you*<br>
Anael didn't wait any longer, she kissed him back, after recovering herself from a state of ecstasy. Neither of them thought that after living in such poor conditions they could finally be worthy of happiness. And not just any happiness. The kind which doesn't fade, does not get smaller and darker after decades. The kind which endures.<br>
Would you like to share my bed from this point forward? What do you say?<br>
It would be my pleasure, love.<br>
Love...such fragile thing, tended by two individuals who met by mere accident, or maybe... it was their destiny. Kraum'daidh continued to sleep with Anael, both metaphorically and sexually. They shared and experienced new pleasures and fantasies day after day. Each had something to show to the other. He was a kind of sorcerer, so tiredness wasn't an issue, they could continue for days and not take a break. Kraum'daidh even disguised himself as human, to be more familiar, but Anael insisted on his true form, she fell in love with him, as a whole, not just for his looks. The same could be said for him. Anael was shy at first, she never had any man before, never participated in something so... *intense*.<br><br>
But nothing lasts forever. Well, not entirely, but mortals eventually die. Anael wanted to stay with Kraum'daidh forever but fate had a different plan for her. She tended to her garden every day, but never noticed a strange flower growing among her other flowers. It didn't stick out, didn't have any strange colors, signs, that maybe it was a curse, specifically for her. It was from her father. Her father was no ordinary man. He was an emperor. The Emperor of the Golden Lands. Obviously, he couldn't have let her only child fall in love with a lich, after all, he needed an heir. But Anael thought her father was a common farmer and that he died in a war. Looks can be deceiving.<br><br>
Kraum'daidh went into their room and noticed a small diary. It was Anael's. The curiosity got the better of him. He opened it, and what he found shocked him. The dates. On the left upper corner it was, bright as day. Must have been an illusion. 2023... It current date was 3134, it was 1111 year difference. He couldn't believe what he saw, so he flipped the pages. It was not a misspelling, she really did write that page in 2023. He couldn't make sense of it, so he asked...<br> 
Darling, I'm deeply sorry, but I took a look at your diary and something caught my eye. Why is the dating start from 2023?<br>
What are you talking about? I got that diary when I was 6. Why would I put 2023 when I was born in 3115? You are being weird.<br>
After Anael looked at her own diary, which she wrote with her own hands, she started shaking. She started to get the shivers, cold ran through her veins, her breath grew heavy.<br>
No, that, that can't be. Why? How? No. It is not possible, I remember writing these pages. No, I'm hallucinating. It is not real, can't BE!<br>
As she said that, her strength left her. She fell asleep. Kraum'daidh did everything he could. Every spell, every incantation, every ritual. In a last desperate attempt, he broke his one rule. He swore it long before Anael and wished to uphold it longer. He only saw Anael falling asleep and losing her will to live. He summoned the great goddess Dragtuna, the very being who brings every life into Algengur and who has a record of each and every one. After gathering the necessary ingredients to summon her, he made an attempt. He failed. His rage started to build up, as he started losing his only chance to save Anael. After the second attempt he succeeded. There she was, in all her might. There was only one setback... elder liches aren't blessed by Dragtuna. They are no children of nature. So the conversation could take an interesting turn.<br>
Tell me, lich, why shouldn't I incinerate you in this instant?<br>
Because I am hopeless. If you kill me now, I will welcome death as a friend.<br>
I can't possibly imagine what can break an elder lich. What abomination was the catalyst that led to an elder lich's fall?<br>
Hope. Her name was Anael. The kindest, most caring being I've ever met. But now, she sleeps, forever... I turn to you, please, I'd give anything to you just so I could see her one more time.<br>
My my, what a big request. Do you know, *how* she died, or let me rephrase, *why* she died?<br>
You mean it wasn't a natural death?<br>
My dear, she was so happy and free by your side that it even caught my eye. But the reason why she no longer holds your hand won't be pleasant. Are you ready?<br>
Tell me, now!<br>
She is not just a farmer girl. Not just a victim of endless wars in this land. She is, or was, the heir to the throne of the Golden Lands. But her father, who she long have forgotten, couldn't stand her being happy with and elder lich. So he made sure it comes to an end.<br>
So you are trying to tell me, her long dead father, murdered her own daughter instead of killing me? You can't be serious.<br>
Who said her father died? She only knew one thing: her family never returned. The why is a question for an another day.<br>
Kraum'daidh couldn't take it anymore, the fury he concealed away burst out in one big shockwave. It swept through like a hurricane, sparing neither tree nor mountain. His rage was so dark and blinding, it washed away every bit of life from the land.<br>
Tell. Me. What. To. Do.<br>
I can only give you one thing, not much, but maybe enough for you to find peace again. I can bring her soul back but only for a brief moment.<br>
It will be enough, thank you!<br>
As Dragtuna faded away, Anael took her place. But Kraum'daidh didn't come unprepared.<br>
Hello love, it really is you?<br>
Yes, it is me, I couldn't do without you. Please tell me the way to bring you back.<br>
I'm gone my dear, bringing me back is not possible, not entirely.<br>
What do you mean?<br>
My heart, I give it to you. After everything, every precious moment, you deserve it. Liches possess great power. To control the dead. And their souls. Please, let me serve the nature again, let me be the calm and peace for others, just as I was for you.<br>
As you wish my Anael. I will build a place that will be called the land of peace for anybody who seeks refuge. Please know that I've always loved you.<br>
I love you too.<br>
As they said their last goodbye, Kraum'daidh became calm and harmonious again. The blast he left after him turned everything to dust, only volcanos remained. The heartbreak was so devastating it drew all the happiness from every atom in the land. Even their colors. That's how Ermir's black sand desert was created. After that day, he had one purpose. To bring her love's wish to reality. He knew Anael as a knowledgeable and friendly human, so he decided to build the biggest Archive the world ever seen. He put it in a place where no one could reach it. In the realm, between realms. He used her heart as a core for the Archive, as it was no longer a common library. It had a soul. It welcomed and took care of anybody who seeked aid. After he finally finished the monumental architecture, he started spreading the word among those who needed it. He made the ritual easy for those who really seek aid, and hard for those who would wanna exploit it's powers. For the common people, every item in the ritual was clear. This was the riddle he conceived:<br>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
In shadows it grins, a memory of battles and sins.<br>
Glittering and keen, a herald of victories unseen.<br>
Mightier than the hand that guides, yet voiceless in its tale it confides.<br>
A storyteller's aid, crafting tales with every stroke laid.<br>
A coveted prize, it's worth measured by the gleam in their eyes.<br>
