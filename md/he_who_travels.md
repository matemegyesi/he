## He, who travels
They say you get used to being alone. It is comparable to being sick. You feel powerless. He starts to wonder what caused it, but never gets to the answer. Salvation for this illness is joy. Being happy. A single person can be the source, who loosens the root of the problem. Lykke...
He, who admits his place in the world will find himself wondering, why?
This question itself has no answer, lucidity comes, not when you understand the question, but when you start to comprehend it.
>*The cycle of life isn't a question to be answered, but a reality to experience. We must go with it's flow, feel it*.

This is the name given to a stranger, who appears out of thin air, who performs miraculous acts toward the people of the land. He, who travels has no name, never been uttered. But that does not mean he has no consciousness. He simply has no intention to share it. Loosing your motivation impacts you.

## He, who rests
Thou shall know peace, It is a state, where the thoughts become still, like water after a storm. Wearing weakness as armor becomes the peaceful mind's weapon.

## He, who tries
I crave a thing many have. Not because of resentment, but the absence of opportunity. He, who tries too hard, sometimes finds himself on the very path, he so strongly wished to avoid. He, who avoids his destiny, will find himself on the same path.

These are the dogmas of Togadar. He learnt to respect and follow there rules he built over his journeys. After studying spells, learnings and doing researches of a long destroyed empire, he realies there is a path. When you come from an unknown past, you will sooner or later find the origins of your being. But when you realize you are the son of a god and a demon, you start having even more questions. Not knowing your parents' names pr their background gives you the choice. The choice to build your own destiny. This is the path He, who travels has chosen.
