In a world devoid of life, a lone wanderer treads across the desolate landscape. Dressed in ragged attire, the figure moves quietly, leaving faint marks on the dry ground. Against the bleak sky, it stands as a solemn reminder of perseverance amidst abandonment, carrying the echoes of a forgotten time. He carries tha fate of those who were lost through time. A sin waiting redemption, in an echoing emptiness. Every mountain, every tavern, every forest now suffers the curse of silence. Where do we draw the line between dead and alive? Is that a question of life, or a purpose to keep wandering where sentience shifts to an absurd search. A craving. Living as if thou was bound to suffer the consequences of hope. Not knowing how long was his sanity lost, turning into a lonely construct of reality. He stopped searching. He left the very thing many would kill for: hope. Welcoming destruction as a long friend meant the only salvation he could accomplish. Standing on top of mountains where birds flew to a fitter place, leaving marks on echoing halls where wars started and ended. There is the suffering caused by those who never wanted to make dreams come true. An endless calling to the voice of past, echoing like waves, getting magnified by the mark of a lone wolf. Loneliness kills the soul, cripples the mind and binds the will.  
He felt alone, for a long time. Always searching for one thing. A single purpose. This unforgettable destination in life earned his will back.   
Aeon learned to appricate the small details in his hollow life. After living in isolation for lifetimes, one day, he stopped. He started noticing an unusual phenomenon, which at first glance seemed like an illusion. It was not possible by the rules of consequences. He never wanted this. Never dreamed that this would happen. But the thing he saw that day changed him. Razed the foundation of his character. A dream is lovely only while it lasts. He wanted to believe a simple version of what happened. Losing hope does horrible things to a man. He saw... her. His one and only love. Diana. And that day he decided to try again. Try harder. Be stronger. To try again and expect different outcomes is the definition of a fool. But he was a fool for love.
In 561313, the Great War ended. It decimated the population of Algengur. Bloody wars and destruction everywhere. Aeon fought side by side of his wife. Together, they achieved great things. Freed the people of Anamareth, purified the great lakes of Dunalan. But what came next, nullified their every effort. It was a war of magnitude never seen before. Gods and demons fought and clashed, but a winner never came out on top. One could not dominate the other. Aeon, came with the solution. Diana opened the Gates of Foresight and predicted the total calamity of the realms. To avoid this Aeon split the realms, to be separate again. Many Realm Gates were opened during the war and severing this connection would have resolved their problem. So he believed. To pull off a spell of this capacity he needed every last ounce of magic Amarinthos, the Realm of the Unknown. The spell was success, the realms were on their own again, demons and gods in their right place. If we throw a rock in lake, it creates waves, which vanish after moments. But if we never stop throwing rocks, the waves only get bigger and bigger, until they destroy the surroundings. This is what happened to fabric of reality. Never ending waves of magical impluses bombarded the walls of the 13 realms. Aeon miscalculated himself and what he could take. Magic of this scope has a price. He failed to meet the criteria for it and suffered the consequences. The flow of time is a force that cannot be stopped. Only altered. We can shape a river but cannot barricade it's movement. The last word Aeon said to his love, Diana, were the only thing he could hold on for the rest of his life. After wandering the mountains and forest alone for eons, trying to find peace and happiness where even the birds don't sing is a hard task. Seeing his love after such long and agonizing time, it came like a needle to a balloon. Shattered his thoughts, crippled his mind. To bend time is to be the beaver who shapes the future. Where it goes, why it happens. He never thought twice about what happens next. His goal, like the scent of spring, allured his mind. He bent the thread of time, looping it into itself. Cause and effect ceases to exist. Was there a beginning? Was there a moment from where everything came and nothing faded? If a lake dries out but rain refills the lake, is it the same lake? If we could seal away our most excruciating memory, would it make us a different person? The answer, is yes. To everything. Our sole purpose in life is to find the thing which grantes us love and happiness unconditionally. For Aeon, it was Diana. The name for incantation of bending time is one of a kind. How can we define the name of an object which changes on the one who is holding it? We can't. But for an incantation to be used he has to know the name for it. That is why bending time was impossible, until now. Aeon figured out why it has no name. Because it cannot have a name. Changing our past is hoping for a better future. But if there is no hope? The feeling Aeon had went from loneliness to a purpose. For once he could think clearly. Like sun piercing through the cracks of a window on a warm summer day. How would you name something that has no shape, no voice, no scent and no history? After Aeon successfully performed bending time, he was back in his tavern, Diana standing next to him. But there was a catch. Only Aeon had the memory of what happened. Diana loved his husband, like no other. It was love of the divine.
