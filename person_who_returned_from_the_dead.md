In a world devoid of life, a lone wanderer treads across the desolate landscape. Dressed in ragged attire, the figure moves quietly, leaving faint marks on the dry ground. Against the bleak sky, it stands as a solemn reminder of perseverance amidst abandonment, carrying the echoes of a forgotten time. He carries tha fate of those who were lost through time. A sin waiting redemption, in an echoing emptiness. Every mountain, every tavern, every forest now suffers the curse of silence. Where do we draw the line between dead and alive? Is that a question of life, or a purpose to keep wandering where sentience shifts to an absurd search. A craving. Living as if thou was bound to suffer the consequences of hope. Not knowing how long was his sanity lost, turning into a lonely construct of reality. He stopped searching. He left the very thing many would kill for: hope. Welcoming destruction as a long friend meant the only salvation he could accomplish. Standing on top of mountains where birds flew to a fitter place, leaving marks on echoing halls where wars started and ended.
